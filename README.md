# Shopping Cart Web Application (ReactJS)

This is a shopping cart web application built with ReactJS, created as a hobby project to explore modern web technologies, improve my ReactJS skills, and implement features commonly found in e-commerce platforms.

## Features
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication using Clerk, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Stripe Payment Integration**: Seamlessly integrated Stripe for handling secure payments and checkout flows.
- **Responsive UI**: Beautiful, responsive design built with Daisy UI, an open-source library for styling UI components.
- **State Management**: Utilized Reactâ€™s Context API for global state management across the app, keeping track of cart items, user authentication, and payment status.
- **Product Data**: Integrated with the Fake Store API to fetch a variety of products and display them dynamically on the site.
